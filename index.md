# About Me 😁
I am currently a second-year Master's Degree Candidate at Chongqing Technology and Business University. Supervised by Prof. [Huafeng Qin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5jvXcJ0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I obtained B.S. degree in Internet of Things Engineering from Pass Collage of Chongqing Technology and Business University in 2022.

I am interested in Computer Vision and Biometric Identification. My current work focuses on Mixup Data Augmentation and Vein Identification.
